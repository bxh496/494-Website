# Education
My goals for the immediate future are to finish my degree and go out into industry in order to continue advancing my learning and understanding of software system design or security. Looking further out, within 10 years I'd have liked to switched into at least 1 new job and be looking at settling somewhere for the long term. Potentially I'd like to go back to school and get a masters in security in order to solidify my prospects to the future.

If we look at the suite of security classes which I took at Iowa State, CPRE 431, 530, and 532, I've gained valuable experience in taking into account potential security problems when coming up with software solutions. Simply solving a problem doesn't do much good if in solving it you open yourself up to a whole mess of exploitable issues by ignoring the possibility of security. It also opens up a bunch of ethical possibilities in interacting with society and what to protect for them vs. let them protect themselves.

I took Poly Sci 251 which is a course in International Politics. This course allowed me to view problems from the socioeconomic and political viewpoints of other nations which will allow me to better consider how my designs could make an impact in a global market. 

In Econ 101 we examined basic macroeconomics. Obviously this gave me some insight into dealing with money. Equations and knowledge from this class ended up coming in handy later when we I took the required project management course and we discussed budgeting.

The entirety of my minor in physics challenged me with very difficult problems and by getting through them I learned all sorts of good problem solving skills which will translate into the ability to solve software problems put in front of me. We're given problems to solve all the time and I believe my experience in my past physics courses has made those problems easier for me.
