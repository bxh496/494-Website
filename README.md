# About Me

**[Resume](Brandon\ Resume\ Security.pdf)**

I'm a senior at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering due to graduate in the Fall of 2017. This website is part of my senior portfolio as outlined by the ABET requirements. It examines and reflects upon everything I've learned and experienced while part of the Engineering College here at ISU. I reflect upon previous projects and work as well as more generally upon what I feel I've gained by attending this university. After graduation I hope to go into the field of cybersecurity in really any form as I have yet to learn anything about the field which doesn't interest me.
