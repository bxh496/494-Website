## Security Assurance Case Design Tool
Our project's goal is to design a graphical interface as an Eclipse plugin which will allow users to create security assurance case diagrams for the purposes of fulfilling security requirements specified by governmental agencies. The eventual goal is to not just be able to build these diagrams, but to have these diagrams dynamically interact with code and tests they're tied to in order to be able to confirm conformity to standards at a glance.

At the present we're working to create the GUI using Eclipse's Graphiti API, based on the EMF framework. The website for Graphiti can be found [here](https://eclipse.org/graphiti/). We've been using a lot of the tutorials and working on expanding from the default features available in order to speed up development time and thus far have managed to create the various components of the diagram and a large number of the features the components need to be able to do such as resize or hold text. In the future we'll be dealing with the more technical aspects of the projects such as getting the diagrams to tie to code and react to changes in that code in order to deal with security concerns.

System security is an ever increasing concern for anybody designing computer systems. This project will ideally reduce the hassle for developers to ensure their code is up to the standards expected of whatever they're attempting to conform to. When discussing with Dr. Othmane it seems a lot things need to get done and tracked by hand whenever it comes time to examine conformity to the requirements. This tool should make the process faster allowing for more productive work to get started sooner.
