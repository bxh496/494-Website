## 327 Sound Generation Project
### Project Description
This project was a part of our advanced programming course. The idea behind the project was to create a multi part program which could perform various actions when working with a custom defined sound file. The different components described below are as follows: sndcat, sndinfo, sndgen, xxx, xxx, xxx.

#### The sound file
The file format was defined as .cs229. It consisted of:

#### sndinfo

#### sndgen

### Examples

## 530 Packet Decoder

This project was an effort in properly understanding packet headers and how the data gets parsed by the operating system. The professor provided us with a base program which would capture the packets from the NIC and print them out in 16 bit hex values.
